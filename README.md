# Deep Q-Network (DQN) for Parking Simulation

## Overview

This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for simulating and optimizing autonomous vehicle parking. The DQN model is trained to make parking decisions and achieve efficient and safe parking.

Below is a training video of a simulation of parking.
