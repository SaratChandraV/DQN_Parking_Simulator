# Deep Q-Network (DQN) for Parking Simulation

## Overview

This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for simulating and optimizing autonomous vehicle parking. The DQN model is trained to make parking decisions and achieve efficient and safe parking.

## Features

- Autonomous vehicle parking simulation.
- Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation for decision-making.
- Training the DQN model to optimize parking strategies.
- Testing the trained model's performance in a simulated environment.
